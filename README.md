## The Problem: Linux Instability Anxiety

Every Linux user knows the anxiety of running `sudo apt upgrade`. Updates silently break kernel modules, NVIDIA driver versions mismatch, and Secure Boot complicates everything. Linux fails predictably, but no one checks the engine before hitting the gas.

## The Solution: An Active Interceptor

Sentinel Linux is a proactive system guardian that acts like a stability anti-cheat. Instead of a tool you have to remember to run, Sentinel hooks directly into your native package manager (`apt`, `pacman`).

When you initiate an update, Sentinel intercepts the command, simulates the transaction in the background, and cross-references incoming kernel versions against your current `dkms` dependencies and `mokutil` states. If an update will brick your graphical interface or network drivers, Sentinel completely halts the installation and warns you.

Sentinel does not replace your package manager. It performs deterministic pre-flight audits and optional recovery orchestration.

## Core Features

- **The Vanguard Engine (`sentinel predict`):** _(Live)_ A blazing-fast, RAM-cached (`/dev/shm`) transaction auditor. It evaluates incoming packages in under 200ms, pulling the emergency brake (`sys.exit(1)`) if it detects `/boot` partition saturation, a locked `dpkg` state, or a collision between new kernels and unsigned DKMS modules while Secure Boot is active.

- **Universal Pre-Transaction Hooks:** _(Live)_ Native interceptors injected directly into package managers (using `DPkg::Pre-Install-Pkgs` for `apt`, with `pacman` support planned). Sentinel doesn't need to be run manually—it wakes up automatically at the point of no return.

- **Autonomous Heuristic Engine:** _(Live)_ Sentinel doesn't just rely on static blacklists. It dynamically queries the package manager to analyze the exact paths an unknown package intends to modify. If a package touches critical tripwires (like `/etc/pam.d` or `/boot`), Sentinel flags it, learns the threat, and saves it to its configuration memory.

- **Automated Recovery Guardrails:** _(Live)_ Context-aware integration with `timeshift` and native `btrfs` (`snapper`). Sentinel will only trigger a pre-transaction system snapshot when core boot-chain or critical services are actively threatened, keeping overhead to an absolute minimum and persisting the state to `/var/lib/sentinel`.

- **Atomic Local Rollbacks (`sentinel undo`):** _(Live)_ Strict, dependency-safe transaction reversals. If an update breaks your system's GUI or networking, drop into a TTY terminal and instantly restore your root filesystem to the exact moment before the crash with an interactive, safety-gated rollback UI.

- **Pattern Interpretation (`sentinel diagnose`):** _(In Development)_ A post-crash logic engine that parses `journalctl -p 3 -b -1` errors. It translates cryptic kernel panics from a failed boot into human-readable English and highly specific, actionable terminal commands.

- **Initramfs Rescue Hook:** _(Planned)_ A minimal, POSIX-compliant shell hook injected into the initramfs boot stage. This allows for absolute worst-case emergency recovery, enabling the user to trigger a Sentinel rollback even if the system fails to reach a login screen or a TTY terminal.

## The North Stars of Sentinel

Sentinel Linux is built on four uncompromising principles:

1. **Low Latency:** Intercepts and audits must take milliseconds. No bloated execution.
2. **Low False Positives:** Only wake up the heavy probes when the boot-chain or critical services are genuinely threatened.
3. **Clear Explanations:** Don't just throw errors. Tell the user exactly _why_ it's dangerous and _how_ to fix it.
4. **Reliability > Feature Count:** A half-broken rollback is worse than no rollback. Every feature must be atomic and safe.

## Installation & Setup

Sentinel is built entirely on native open-source binaries with zero proprietary APIs.

Run this single command to securely deploy Sentinel to your system:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GurKalra/sentinel-linux/main/install.sh | bash
```

---

## Usage

Once the hooks are installed, Sentinel runs automatically in the background whenever you use your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt upgrade`). However, you can still use the native Linux commands manually:

- To install the background package manager hooks (Require root):

```bash
sudo sentinel install-hooks
```

- To see the help menu and avaliable commands:

```bash
sentinel --help
```

- To run a system update simulatoin and risk analysis:

```bash
sentinel predict
```

- To diagnose critical system logs from the current boot:

```bash
sentinel diagnose
```

- To safely rollback the system to the last pre-update snapshot (Requires root):

```bash
sudo sentinel undo
```

- To transparently auto-recover crashed services based on log diagnostics (Requires root):

```bash
sudo sentinel heal
```
